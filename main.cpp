 * Course: Chaffey College 2021-Fall CS2
 * Prof: Dr. Tracy Kocher
 * Date: 2021-10-12
 * Project: 9.09 (NINE-NINE!)
 * Coder: Justin Gries
 * Tester(s):
 *
 * Prompt: After closing time, the store manager would like to know how much
 * business was transacted during the day.
 *  Modify the CashRegister class to enable this functionality.
 *  Supply member functions get_sales_total and get_sales_count to get the
    total amount of all sales and the number of sales.
 *  Supply a member function reset_sales that resets any counters and totals
    so that the next dayâ€™s sales start from zero.

 * Notes to self:   CashRegister class is discussed in Section 9.3
 *                  This may build off of projects 9.6 through 9.8
